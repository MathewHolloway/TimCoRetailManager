Application Ideas:
*Actually interact with the inventory
*Move the API to Azure
*CI/CD process
*Deploy the Desktop App to Blob storage for download
*Introduce a web-based inventory control system
*Web-based reporting
*A Xamarin Forms app for a mobile register

2. Set up a simple task board in Azure DevOps
3. CI/CD with Azure DevOps (move sourece code to Azure DevOps?)
4. Move the API to Azure
5. Move the database to Azure SQL
6. Deploy the desktop app to Blob storage
7. Web-based inventory control system
